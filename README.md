# ECNP-NNADR

## Description
This repository contains code for various stages of neuroimaging data processing, quality control, and machine learning analysis. The code is implemented in both R and MATLAB.

## Software Requirements
- R v4.1 (and above)
- MATLAB 2020b (and above)
- Tested in Ubuntu environment

## Data Processing
The data processing scripts utilize the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) and Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT12) software packages. For more information on CAT12, please visit [ENIGMA CAT12](https://neuro-jena.github.io/enigma-cat12/).

## Quality Control
Quality control scripts are provided to ensure the integrity and reliability of the processed neuroimaging data. These scripts are implemented in MATLAB version r2022a.

## Machine Learning Analysis
Machine learning analysis is conducted using the Machine Learning in R package (MLR). For more information on MLR, please refer to [MLR documentation](https://mlr.mlr-org.com/).

## Directory Structure
- `Data_Processing/`: Contains MATLAB scripts for preprocessing and analysis using SPM and CAT12.
- `Quality_Control/`: Includes MATLAB scripts for conducting quality control checks on processed data.
- `Machine_Learning_Analysis/`: Contains R scripts for implementing machine learning algorithms using MLR package.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary software dependencies as mentioned above.
3. Navigate to the respective directories (`Data_Processing/`, `Quality_Control/`, `Machine_Learning_Analysis/`) and run the scripts according to your requirements.
